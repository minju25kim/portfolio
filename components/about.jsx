          Since I found my engineering study is not what I want to dedicate for
          10 years in my future. I tried to learn many other things. And I found
          freecodecamp and started to learn basic HTML CSS and Javascript.
          First, I thought it's totally cool things to do with laptop. I dreamed
          to do coding as my job and decided to learn more seriously.

          While I'm deciding, I lost my first official job in Malaysia and
          decided to come to UK for more exciting adventures. And I found London
          has a lot of opportunities for learners and also people who is seeking
          for a job. I was searching for coding study group for working with
          other like minded people and google search result showed me Founders
          and Coders based in London.
